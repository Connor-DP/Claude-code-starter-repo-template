# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

<!--
INSTRUCTIONS FOR FILLING OUT THIS DOCUMENT:

This is the "Vision" document. It tells the AI WHAT to build and WHY.

If you're unsure how to fill this out, ask Claude:
  "Help me fill out the PRD based on my idea: [describe your project in 2-3 sentences]"

Claude will ask clarifying questions and help structure your product vision.

TIPS:
- Be specific about your target users (not just "everyone")
- Focus on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) first
- Out of Scope is as important as In Scope
- Success metrics should be measurable (not "users will be happy")
-->
